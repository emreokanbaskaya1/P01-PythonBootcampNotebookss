# 📘 P01 - Python Fundamentals 

This repository represents the first major phase of my Python learning journey. It contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks covering fundamental and intermediate-level Python topics. Each notebook is designed to help develop my skills in core programming, logic, and real-world coding practices.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### ✅ Core Python Concepts
- Numbers, Strings, Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
- Booleans and Type Casting
- Operators: Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical
- Control Structures: if, elif, else
- Loops: for, while, break, continue, pass
- Functions: Parameters, return values, scope, and lambda functions
- Object-Oriented Programming: Classes, attributes, methods, encapsulation

### ✅ Error Handling & File Operations
- try-except blocks
- Error types and debugging strategies
- Reading and writing files (text-based)

### ✅ Advanced Topics
- Recursion (solving problems using self-referencing functions)
- Type Annotations (adding type hints to improve code readability and reliability)

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies
Language: Python 3.13

Environment: Jupyter Notebook (via PyCharm)

Version Control: Git + GitHub

Platform: Windows OS

### 🎓 Based on a Udemy Bootcamp
These notebooks are based on the Python section of the "100 Days of Artificial Intelligence Bootcamp" by Atıl Samancıoğlu.
