# 📘 P01 - Python Bootcamp Notebooks

This repository contains the first section of my Python learning journey, where I systematically studied the core concepts of Python programming through hands-on coding exercises, quizzes, and mini-projects. The materials covered here lay a strong foundation for future work in data science, machine learning, and AI development.

All notebooks are structured to reinforce both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, making this repository a comprehensive starting point for anyone aiming to master Python from the ground up.

## 🧠 What I Learned

### ✅ Python Fundamentals
- **Variables and Data Types**: Including `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, and dynamic typing principles in Python.
- **Type Casting**: Converting between different data types using built-in functions like `int()`, `str()`, `float()`, etc.
- **Comments and Readability**: Writing clean, understandable code using inline and block comments.

### ✅ Mathematical and Logical Operations
- **Arithmetic Operators**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, floor division, and modulus.
- **Assignment Operators**: Including `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, and more.
- **Comparison & Logical Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, as well as `and`, `or`, `not` logic structures.

### ✅ Conditional Statements
- Mastery of `if`, `elif`, and `else` to create decision trees within programs.
- Use of nested conditionals and complex logic chains.
- Real-world applications like simple decision-making scripts.

### ✅ Loops and Iteration
- **`for` and `while` loops**: Executing blocks of code repeatedly based on a condition or sequence.
- **Loop Control Statements**: Usage of `break`, `continue`, and `pass` for flow control.
- **Looping Through Data Structures**: Iterating over lists, tuples, strings, and ranges.

### ✅ Functions
- Writing reusable blocks of code with both required and default parameters.
- **Return Statements**: Capturing function outputs for downstream logic.
- Understanding **scope**: Local vs. global variables.
- **Lambda Functions**: Creating anonymous, one-liner functions for concise logic.

### ✅ Built-in Functions and Pythonic Syntax
- Extensive use of functions like `len()`, `range()`, `type()`, `input()`, `enumerate()`, `zip()`, and more.
- Writing idiomatic and efficient Python code using list comprehensions and generator expressions.

### ✅ Problem Solving and Algorithmic Thinking
- Applying Python syntax to solve practical problems and quizzes.
- Structuring logic in a readable, scalable, and testable way.
- Debugging and improving code quality iteratively.
